\section{Discussion}\label{sec:4}
This paper presents an \oos\ test statistic similar to \poscw\ that is
asymptotically normal when comparing nested or non-nested models.
Normality is achieved by estimating the alternative model using a
fixed-length rolling window --- as do Clark and West --- but
estimating the benchmark model with a recursive window.  Simulations
indicate that the new statistic behaves similarly to Clark and West's
original test when the \dgp\ is stable but can have much higher power
when the \dgp\ has structural breaks. We also have presented an
empirical study of the equity premium that demonstrates how to use
these results with several alternative models.
