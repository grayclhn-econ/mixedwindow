  \noindent This paper develops a modification of \citepos[\textit{J.
    Econom.}]{ClW:07} adjusted out-of-sample $t$-test. We propose
  using a recursive window to estimate the benchmark model but a
  fixed-length rolling window to estimate the alternative. The
  resulting statistic is asymptotically normal even when the models
  are nested. The
  paper also presents Monte Carlo evidence that this statistic has
  much higher power than existing out-of-sample statistics in a common
  use-case for these tests: when the \dgp\ is subject to instability.
  This procedure is then used to analyze
  \citepos[\textit{Rev. Finan. Stud.}]{GoW:08} excess returns dataset
  and supports their finding that the equity premium is unpredictable
  out-of-sample.
