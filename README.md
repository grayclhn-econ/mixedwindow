mixedwindow.git
===============

This directory contains the code necessary to run the analysis for the
paper, "An asymptotically normal out-of-sample test based on mixed
estimation windows," by Gray Calhoun. I am making this code available
so that other researchers can verify and reproduce my results, but I
have no plans to develop it into a stand-alone package.

The file `mixedwindow.tex` is not, as it contains the main text of the
paper. The R libraries `dbframe-R-library` and `oosanalysis-R-library`
have both been released under the GPL elsewhere, but I am their author
and am relicesning them under the MIT license here.
