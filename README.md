mixedwindow.git
===============

This directory contains the code necessary to run the analysis for the
paper, "An asymptotically normal out-of-sample test based on mixed
estimation windows," by Gray Calhoun. I am making this code available
so that other researchers can verify and reproduce my results, but I
have no plans to develop it into a stand-alone package.
