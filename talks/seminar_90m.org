#+Author: Gray Calhoun \newline Iowa State University

* Introduction
** Very quick overview of the talk
   + Out-of-sample tests: assess one or more models by
     1) producing a series of forecasts
     2) testing hypotheses about their properties (unbiasedness, MDS, etc.)
     e.g. Meese and Rogoff (1983)

   {{{s}}}

   + Discuss some of the theory behind oos tests & some shortcomings
   + Propose a new oos statistic
     - Avoids some of the problems other oos statistics have
     - Has high power against some forms of misspecification
   + Monte Carlo evidence of finite-sample performance
   + Extensions to evaluating many models (multiple hypothesis testing)
   + Empirical exercise based on Goyal and Welch (2008)
